# Multimachine

There are 2 different types of universally scalable multimachines:

* <a href="https://github.com/faerietree/multimachine_lightspeed_precise">multimachine_lightspeed_precise</a> (small to medium volume, cartesian)
  * 3D Printer UniProKit Speedy [Universal Prototyping Kit + V belts]

* <a href="https://github.com/faerietree/multimachine_massive_slow">multimachine_massive_slow</a>
  * 4D Fr√§DreMas [made from scrap + lead screws + sheets of acrylic glass]
  * 4D CiPriMa [made from U + I beams + lead screws]
  * 4D <a href="https://github.com/faerietree/manipulator">manipulator</a>

It is assumed that a hybrid - i.e. the perfect machine that combines all properties in one - not exists.
High mass physically counteracts high speed (e.g. belts) due to inertia.

Note that acrylic glass is a useful addition to all machines for safety and heat consistency.
